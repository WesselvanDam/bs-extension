# BrightSpace Open In New Tab Extension
This is the source code of a Chrome extension that enables users of the [BrightSpace](https://www.d2l.com/nl/brightspace/) virtual learning platform to open PDF files,
video's, and text files in a new tab. This is not possible by default, which is in cases rather cumbersome, especially if the user wants to have multiple files open at
once.
